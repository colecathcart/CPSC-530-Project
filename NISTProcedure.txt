Data collection:
Observe Battleship games played by players differing skill levels. Record each move as a pair of coordinates (row, column), where row and column are integers representing the grid positions.

Preprocessing:
a. Convert each coordinate pair into a single integer by concatenating the row and column numbers (e.g., (3, 5) becomes 35).
b. Normalize the data by dividing each integer by the maximum possible value (e.g., 99 for a 10x10 grid).
c. Compute the entropy value of the moves for each game using the Shannon entropy formula. This will give you a measure of the randomness of the moves in each game.

Generating the random numbers:
a. For each game, use the computed entropy value as a seed for a deterministic random number generator to generate a list of numbers.

Testing for randomness using NIST test suite:
a. Format the generated random numbers as a binary sequence.
b. Divide the binary sequence into non-overlapping blocks of equal length (e.g., 64 bits).
c. Run the NIST Statistical Test Suite on the binary sequence (Frequency Test, Block Frequency Test, Runs Test, Longest Run of Ones Test, etc.)
d. Analyze the results of the NIST tests, looking for p-values above a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.01). If the majority of the tests pass, the sequence can be considered random.
